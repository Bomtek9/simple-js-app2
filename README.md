Before this app, I had no app building experience. So, this was challenging and often times daunting. However, I kept going no matter what. In the end I am proud of my first app, the UI, and functionality. This app was designed with HTML, CSS, and ES6+ JavaScript for the average, working trainer who needs a simple, portable Pokédex for their quest to catch 'em all! I built it throughout the intro to JavaScript course of my CareerFoundry bootcamp. Specifically, the app covers all 150 Pokémon from the original red/blue games that took the world by storm in the late 1990s.

Features
We took a functional programming approach, and initially did as much in JavaScript over HTML as possible to practice and learn (before implementing Bootstrap).
Loaded data from the RESTful Pokémon API: PokéAPI

Polyfills:
Fetch and Promise

The trainer/user can:
View all 150 Pokémon
Click on a Pokémon for a modal pop-up to show important information needed to aid them as they battle and capture it.


Dependencies
This Pokédex app relies on Bootstrap. I created a fully functional app, then, in the final section, had to rework everything to utilize some of Bootstrap's features and components (such as their navbar and modals).

Credit and Contact
I would like to thank PokeAPI, because that API was invaluable in bringing this app to life.

If any of you trainers/users have thoughts on how I can improve the Pokédex, or even this README, don't hesitate to reach out!
